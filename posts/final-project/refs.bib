abstract = {Predicting box-office receipts of a particular motion picture has intrigued many scholars and industry leaders as a difficult and challenging problem. In this study, the use of neural networks in predicting the financial performance of a movie at the box-office before its theatrical release is explored. In our model, the forecasting problem is converted into a classification problem-rather than forecasting the point estimate of box-office receipts, a movie based on its box-office receipts in one of nine categories is classified, ranging from a ‘flop’ to a ‘blockbuster.’ Because our model is designed to predict the expected revenue range of a movie before its theatrical release, it can be used as a powerful decision aid by studios, distributors, and exhibitors. Our prediction results is presented using two performance measures: average percent success rate of classifying a movie's success exactly, or within one class of its actual performance. Comparison of our neural network to models proposed in the recent literature as well as other statistical techniques using a 10-fold cross validation methodology shows that the neural networks do a much better job of predicting in this setting.}

 abstract = {This article presents two alternative explanations for the role of stars in motion pictures. Either informed insiders signal project quality by hiring an expensive star, or stars capture their expected economic rent. These approaches are tested on a sample of movies produced in the 1990s. Means comparisons suggest that star‐studded films bring in higher revenues. However, regressions show that any big budget investment increases revenues. Sequels, highly visible films and “family oriented” ratings also contribute to revenues. A higher return on investment is correlated only with G or PG ratings and marginally with sequels. This is consistent with the “rent capture” hypothesis.},

abstract = {Forecasting box office revenue of a movie before its theatrical release is a difficult and challenging problem. In this study, a multi-layer BP neural network (MLBP) with multi-input and multi-output is employed to build the prediction model. All the movies are divided into six categories ranged from “blob” to “bomb” according to their box office incomes, and the purpose is to predict a film into the right class. The selections of the input variables are based on market survey and their weight values are determined by using statistical method. As to the design of the neural network structure, theoretical guidance and plentiful experiments are combined to optimize the hidden layers’ parameters which include the number of hidden layers and their node numbers. Then a classifier with dynamic thresholds is used to standardize the output for the first time, and it improves the robustness of the model to a high level. Finally, a 6-fold cross-validation experiment methodology is used to measure the performance of the prediction model. The comparison results with the MLP method show that the MLBP prediction model achieves more satisfactory results, and it is more reliable and effective to solve the problem.}
